# Code to set up the Nexus. It will need to
# * Create Nexus
# * Set the right options for the Nexus Deployment Config
# * Load Nexus with the right repos
# * Configure Nexus as a docker registry
# Hint: Make sure to wait until Nexus if fully up and running
#       before configuring nexus with repositories.
#       You could use the following code:
# while : ; do
#   echo "Checking if Nexus is Ready..."
#   oc get pod -n ${GUID}-nexus|grep '\-2\-'|grep -v deploy|grep "1/1"
#   [[ "$?" == "1" ]] || break
#   echo "...no. Sleeping 10 seconds."
#   sleep 10
# done

# Ideally just calls a template
# oc new-app -f ../templates/nexus.yaml --param .....
